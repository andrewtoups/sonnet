    And yet methinks I have astronomy,
    But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
    Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
    Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
    Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
    Or say with princes if it shall go well
    By oft predict that I in heaven find.
    But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
    And constant stars in them I read such art
    As truth and beauty shall together thrive
    If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:
      Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
      Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.</span>
